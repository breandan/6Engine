## 6Engine ##

6Engine is an open-source, developer focused block engine.

It's an alternative to Minecraft with the following goals in mind:
- API first. Performance right after that.
- Servers should have as much control over clients as possible.
- Cubic chunks, for 'infinite' worlds that expand in the vertical direction as much as the horizontal.

And all these things will be supported from the beginning. Better yet, it will be free. Free software.

Some other potential features are:
- Chunk compression over networks
- Clientside chunk cacheing. Prevents servers from having to resend old chunks. Can be verified by sending the MD5
  hash of the cached chunk to the server.

Contributions are welcomed and encouraged as soon as I get the licence up. It will be MIT.
IntelliJ IDEA is the recommended IDE for this project, since the settings files were generated by it.
