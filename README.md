## 6Engine ##

6Engine is an open-source, developer focused block engine.

It's an alternative to Minecraft with the following goals in mind:
- Modding/plugin API first. Performance right after that.
- Servers should have as much control over clients as possible.
- World made of cubic chunks, for 'infinite' worlds that expand in the vertical direction as much as the horizontal.

And all these things will be supported from the beginning. Better yet, it will be free. Free software.

This is purely an engine- no concrete mc-style survival "game mechanics" will be added. That is up to plugin developers.

Contributions are welcomed and encouraged as soon as I get the licence up. It will be MIT.
IntelliJ IDEA is the recommended IDE for this project, since the settings files were generated by it.
